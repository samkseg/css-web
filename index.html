                            src="images/Faux_Neon_Cocktails_Sign.svg" alt="neon cocktail"></a>A cocktail is an alcoholic
                    mixed drink. Most commonly, cocktails
                    are
                    either a single spirit or a combination of spirits, mixed with other ingredients such as juices,
                    flavored syrups, tonic water, shrubs, and bitters. Cocktails vary widely across regions of the
                    world, and many websites publish both original recipes and their own interpretations of older
                    and
                    more famous cocktails. The origins of the word "cocktail" have been debated. The first written
                    mention of "cocktail" as a beverage appeared in The Farmers Cabinet, 1803 in the United States.
                    The
                    first definition of a cocktail as an alcoholic beverage appeared three years later in The
                    Balance
                    and Columbian Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806.Traditionally, cocktail ingredients
                    included spirits, sugar, water and bitters, however, this definition evolved throughout the
                    1800s,
                    to include the addition of a liqueur. In 1862 Jerry Thomas published a bartender's guide called
                    How
                    to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion which included 10 cocktail recipes using bitters
                    to
                    differentiate from other drinks such as punches and cobblers. Cocktails continued to evolve and
                    gain
                    popularity throughout the 1900s, with the term eventually expanding to cover all mixed drinks.
                    In
                    1917 the term "cocktail party" was coined by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri.
                    With
                    wine and beer being less available during the Prohibition in the United States (1920-1933),
                    liquor-based cocktails became more popular due to accessibility, followed by a decline in
                    popularity
                    during the late 1960s.</p>

                <p>The early to mid-2000s saw the rise of cocktail culture through the style of mixology which mixes
                    traditional cocktails and other novel ingredients. By 2023, the so-called "cocktail in a can"
                    had
                    proliferated (at least in the United States) to become a common item in liquor stores. In the
                    modern
                    world and the Information Age, cocktail recipes are widely shared online on websites. Cocktails
                    and
                    restaurants that serve them are frequently covered and reviewed in tourism magazines and guides.
                    Some cocktails, such as the Mojito, Manhattan, and Martini have become staples in both
                    restaurants and pop culture phenomena.</p>

                    The term "cocktail" can refer to a wide variety of drinks; it is typically a mixed drink
                    containing
                    alcohol.

                    When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a mixer, such as soda or fruit juice, it
                    is
                    a highball. Many of the International Bartenders Association Official Cocktails are highballs.
                    When
                    a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a liqueur, it is a duo, and when it adds
                    cream or
                    a cream-based liqueur, it is a trio. Additional ingredients may be sugar, honey, milk, cream,
                    and
                    various herbs.

                    Mixed drinks without alcohol that resemble cocktails can be known as "zero-proof" or "virgin"
                    cocktails or "mocktails".

                <h3>Development</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There is a lack of clarity on the origins of cocktails. Traditionally cocktails were a mixture
                    of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters. By the 1860s, however, a cocktail frequently included a
                    liqueur.

                    The first publication of a bartenders' guide which included cocktail recipes was in 1862 - How
                    to
                    Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion, by "Professor" Jerry Thomas. In addition to recipes
                    for
                    punches, sours, slings, cobblers, shrubs, toddies, flips, and a variety of other mixed drinks
                    were
                    10 recipes for "cocktails". A key ingredient differentiating cocktails from other drinks in this
                    compendium was the use of bitters. Mixed drinks popular today that conform to this original
                    meaning
                    of "cocktail" include the Old Fashioned whiskey cocktail, the Sazerac cocktail, and the
                    Manhattan
                    cocktail.

                    The ingredients listed (spirits, sugar, water, and bitters) match the ingredients of an Old
                    Fashioned, which originated as a term used by late 19th-century bar patrons to distinguish
                    cocktails made the "old-fashioned" way from newer, more complex cocktails.

                    In the 1869 recipe book Cooling Cups and Dainty Drinks, by William Terrington, cocktails are
                    described as:

                    Cocktails are compounds very much used by "early birds" to fortify the inner man, and by those
                    who
                    like their consolations hot and strong.

                    The term highball appears during the 1890s to distinguish a drink composed only of a distilled
                    spirit and a mixer.

                    Published in 1902 by Farrow and Jackson, "Recipes of American and Other Iced Drinks" contains
                    recipes for nearly two dozen cocktails, some still recognizable today.

                    The first "cocktail party" ever thrown was allegedly by Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis,
                    Missouri,
                    in May 1917. Walsh invited 50 guests to her home at noon on a Sunday. The party lasted an hour
                    until
                    lunch was served at 1 p.m. The site of this first cocktail party still stands. In 1924, the
                    Roman
                    Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis bought the Walsh mansion at 4510 Lindell Boulevard, and it has
                    served as the local archbishop's residence ever since.

                    During Prohibition in the United States (1920-1933), when alcoholic beverages were illegal,
                    cocktails were still consumed illegally in establishments known as speakeasies. The quality of
                    the
                    liquor available during Prohibition was much worse than previously. There was a shift from
                    whiskey to gin, which does not require aging and is, therefore, easier to produce illicitly.
                    Honey, fruit juices, and other flavorings served to mask the foul taste of the inferior liquors.
                    Sweet cocktails were easier to drink quickly, an important consideration when the establishment
                    might be raided at any moment. With wine and beer less readily available, liquor-based cocktails
                    took their place, even becoming the centerpiece of the new cocktail party.

                    Cocktails became less popular in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, until resurging in the
                    1980s
                    with vodka often substituting for the original gin in drinks such as the martini. Traditional
                    cocktails began to make a comeback in the 2000s, and by the mid-2000s there was a renaissance of
                    cocktail culture in a style typically referred to as mixology that draws on traditional
                    cocktails
                    for inspiration but uses novel ingredients and often complex flavors.

            <h3>Etymology</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The origin of the word "cocktail" is disputed. The first recorded use of cocktail not referring to a
                horse is
                found in The Morning Post and Gazetteer in London, England, March 20, 1798:

                Mr. Pitt,
                two petit vers of "L'huile de Venus"
                Ditto, one of "perfeit amour"
                Ditto, "cock-tail" (vulgarly called ginger)

                The Oxford English Dictionary cites the word as originating in the U.S. The first recorded use of
                cocktail
                as a beverage (possibly non-alcoholic) in the United States appears in The Farmer's Cabinet, April 28,
                1803:

                Drank a glass of cocktail—excellent for the head...Call'd at the Doct's. found Burnham—he looked very
                wise—drank another glass of cocktail.


                The first known definition of a cocktail, by Harry Croswell
                The first definition of cocktail known to be an alcoholic beverage appeared in The Balance and Columbian
                Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806; editor Harry Croswell answered the question, "What is a
                cocktail?":

                Cock-tail is a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters—it is
                vulgarly
                called bittered sling, and is supposed to be an excellent electioneering potion, in as much as it
                renders
                the heart stout and bold, at the same time that it fuddles the head. It is said, also to be of great use
                to
                a democratic candidate: because a person, having swallowed a glass of it, is ready to swallow any thing
                else.

                Dale DeGroff hypothesizes that the word evolved from the French coquetier, for an eggcup in which
                Antoine A.
                Peychaud, creator of Peychaud's Bitters, allegedly used to serve his guests a mix of cognac with a dash
                of
                his bitters.

                Etymologist Anatoly Liberman endorses as "highly probable" the theory advanced by Låftman (1946), which
                Liberman summarizes as follows:

                It was customary to dock the tails of horses that were not thoroughbred [...] They were called
                cocktailed
                horses, later simply cocktails. By extension, the word cocktail was applied to a vulgar, ill-bred person
                raised above his station, assuming the position of a gentleman but deficient in gentlemanly breeding.
                [...]
                Of importance [in the 1806 citation above] is [...] the mention of water as an ingredient. [...] Låftman
                concluded that cocktail was an acceptable alcoholic drink, but diluted, not a "purebred", a thing
                "raised
                above its station". Hence the highly appropriate slang word used earlier about inferior horses and sham
                gentlemen.

                Cocktail historian David Wondrich also speculates that "cocktail" is a reference to gingering, a
                practice
                for perking up an old horse by means of a ginger suppository so that the animal would "cock its tail up
                and
                be frisky."

                Several authors have theorized that "cocktail" may be a corruption of "cock ale".</p>

            <h3>Cocktail of the month: Mojito</h3>
            <br>
            <a href="images/Mojito-1.jpg"><img id="img-mojito" src="images/Mojito-1.jpg" alt="mojito"></a>
            <p>
                Mojito (/moʊ'hi:toʊ/; Spanish: [mo'xito]) is a traditional Cuban punch. The cocktail often consists of
                five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and
                mint. Its combination of sweetness, citrus, and herbaceous mint flavors is intended to complement
                the rum, and has made the mojito a popular summer drink.

                When preparing a mojito, fresh lime juice is added to sugar (or to simple syrup) and mint leaves. The
                mixture is then gently mashed with a muddler. The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the
                essential oils and should not be shredded. Then rum is added and the mixture is briefly stirred to
                dissolve the sugar and to lift the mint leaves up from the bottom for better presentation. Finally, the
                drink is topped with crushed ice and sparkling soda water. Mint leaves and lime wedges are used to
                garnish the glass.

                In Cuba, the mint used to make mojito is most commonly Mentha x villosa (called Yerba Buena or
                Hierbabuena in Cuba) which has a light minty/citrus aroma, but outside of Cuba spearmint is often used
                which has a stronger mint aroma.
